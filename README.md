# ðŸ“™ JavaScript/TypeScript Ã‰tudes

Welcome to the **JavaScript/TypeScript Ã‰tudes** Collection! This repository contains a comprehensive list of exercises designed to help you master **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**. With progressively challenging exercises, these will guide you through essential and advanced features of both programming languages. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this collection will strengthen your skills in JS and TS.

The collection is composed of five chapters with five JavaScript questions each, and a final chapter with six TypeScript questions.

## ðŸ‘€ Introduction

JavaScript is a versatile, dynamic language used widely for web development, while TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that offers enhanced tooling and error-checking features. These exercises provide a practical, hands-on approach to learning both languages, covering:

- Basic syntax and data structures
- Functional programming principles
- Object-oriented programming
- Error handling and debugging
- TypeScript types and interfaces

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get started with these exercises, you'll need to have **Node.js** and **TypeScript** installed on your system.

Once the tools are installed, you can clone this repository and start exploring the exercises:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/etudes-js.git
cd etudes-js
```
